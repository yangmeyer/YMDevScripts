### Setup and Usage
1. Open script in AppleScript Editor, save as Application.
2. Make the Application [invokable through a keyboard shortcut](http://superuser.com/questions/245711/starting-application-with-custom-keyboard-shortcut), e.g. `⇧⌘L`.
3. (For demo purposes:) In iOS Simulator launch Maps app.
4. Hit `⇧⌘L` and choose a direction, and see the blue location indicator move.
